  <h2>About Victor</h2>
  <p>Hey i am victor .My hobby is to watch movies and animations .What i like more about movies is that one can visualize himself in the act.It also relaxes the mind when you have had a rough day out there.In animations, they are funny and plus you can also learn a very helpfull information.

  </p>
  <p>One of the other hobbies that i like is knowing more about cars.Cars have developed over the years and each time there is always a new model.These companies always look for a way to improve their cars since they look at what would be more helpful to  theire buyers.So far according to me my best car model is Dodge Viper.</p>
  <p>This car is almost the fastest car to be created.It was created by Designer Tom Gale.It has a horse power of 640 and its top speed is 206mph.
